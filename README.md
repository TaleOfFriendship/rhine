Project to predict the water levels of the rhine river in Bonn.

At the end of my practical lab on machine learning i had to do a presentation on some data. I had to try to predict the water levels of the rhine river 12 hours in advance but there were no real guidelines on how to do it and this is what i came up with within the 2 weeks deadline.

The techniques used were nothing advanced. Mainly linear regression, PCA and NNs. Interestingly, deeper and more sophisticated NNs like LSTMs or more layered/larger layered NNs did not lead to an improvement.

The two main reasons for this are:
- data itself is not complex enough
- measurements have too high of a variance
