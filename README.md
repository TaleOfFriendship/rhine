Project to predict the water levels of the rhine river in Bonn.

At the end of my practical lab on machine learning i had to do a presentation on some data. I had to try to predict the water levels of the rhine river 12 hours in advance.

The techniques used were nothing complex. Mainly linear regression, PCA and NNs. Interestingly, deeper and more sophisticated NNs like LSTMs or more layered/larger layered NNs did not lead to an improvement.

T√ç think the two main reasons for this are:
- data itself is not complex enough
- measurements have too high of a variance
